### The Day of Life Stored in the Form Does Not Match the Calculated Value {#sec-problem-details-17}

The value of the day of life at the time of the event, which appears on some forms, is automatically calculated from the date of the event, the admission date of the enrolment and the day of life at the time of admission.

If this error message appears in the validation report, we have determined that the stored value for the day of life is incorrect, which in most cases is due to the admission date of the enrolment having been changed after the form in question was completed.

Please update the day of life value in the form (see @sec-solution-11).

If at the same time the error message appears that the stored day of occurrence after admission does not match the calculated value, which is the majority of cases (see @sec-problem-details-18), you only need to perform the procedure described in @sec-solution-11 once to update both values.
