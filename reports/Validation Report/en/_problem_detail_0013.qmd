### The Sum of All Antibiotic Substance Days Is Less Than the Total Number of Antibiotic Days {#sec-problem-details-13}

In the Surveillance End form, the number of days on which a patient received (any) antibiotic treatment (antibiotic days) and the number of days on which each antibiotic substance was used (substance days) are recorded.
By nature, the number of antibiotic days must be less than or equal to the value obtained by adding all substance days.
Unfortunately, the input validation that checks this does not work reliably and can be bypassed, which leads to this error message in the validation report.

Please reopen the Surveillance End form (see @sec-solution-9) and enter the correct values for the individual substance days or the correct value for the antibiotic days.
