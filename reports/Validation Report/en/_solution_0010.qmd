### Opening an Enrolment in the Tracked Entity Instance Dashboard {#sec-solution-10}

When you open the Tracked Entity Instance Dashboard (see @sec-solution-1) of a patient record that contains an open enrolment, it opens automatically.
You can access other closed enrolments by clicking the 'History' link (see @fig-open-enrolment-multiple) in the top left corner of the Tracked Entity Instance Dashboard under Enrolment and then selecting the one you want to open from the history displayed by date.
If this link is missing, there are no other patient enrolments in the corresponding patient record.

If the Tracked Entity Instance Dashboard of the patient record you are opening does not contain any open patient enrolments, the history of patient enrolments will be displayed directly.

Please note that only one enrolment can be open for editing at any one time.
You will therefore need to close an open enrolment (at least temporarily) in order to reopen another one for editing (also see @sec-solution-5).
