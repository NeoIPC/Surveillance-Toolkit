### Opening the Tracked Entity Instance Dashboard of a Patient Record {#sec-solution-1}

To work with a patient record or an enrolment, you need to open the associated [Tracked Entity Instance (TEI) Dashboard](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-240/tracking-individual-level-data/tracker-capture.html#about_tracked_entity_instance_dashboard) in DHIS2.

Normally you do this from the [list of enrolled patients](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-240/tracking-individual-level-data/tracker-capture.html#simple_tracked_entity_instance_search) by clicking on the relevant entry.

Unfortunately, this does not work for patient records without enrolment.
If you do have the NeoIPC Patient ID or other data that you can use in a search, you can use the [Tracker Capture search function](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-240/tracking-individual-level-data/tracker-capture.html#advanced_tracked_entity_instance_search) to find and open the patient record.
