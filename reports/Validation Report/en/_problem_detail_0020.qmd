### The Infection Occurred Within the First Two Days of Hospitalisation of a Referred or (Re-)Admitted Patient {#sec-problem-details-20}

Infections that occur within the first two days in referred or (re-)admitted patients are not considered to be nosocomial infections according to the NeoIPC Surveillance Protocol and therefore cannot be recorded.

Please delete the forms for all infections that are not nosocomial infections according to this definition (see @sec-solution-12) or adjust the infection date (see @sec-solution-7) or the admission date (see @sec-solution-6) if it is an input error.
