### The Admission Date in the Admission Form Differs From the Admission Date in the Enrolment {#sec-problem-details-3}

The NeoIPC Surveillance Platform requires a patient's admission date for internal calculations. The date must be present twice, once in the patient enrolment and once in the admission form (see @fig-the-two-admission-dates).
Normally, the exception form automatically takes the admission date from the patient registration.
There is also an input validation that prevents you from completing an admission form if the admission date does not match the admission date in the patient registration.
But you can change the admission date in the patient registration and confirm the change in the warning dialogue that appears (see @fig-warning-enrolment-admission-date).
The system can make erroneous calculations if it has two different admission dates for the same patient registration. Therefore, this must be prevented.

Please ensure that the correct admission date for the patient in question is entered in both the 'Admission date' field of the enrolment form and the 'Admission date' field of the admission form (see @sec-solution-6).
