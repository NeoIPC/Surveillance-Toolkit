### The Patient Record Has a Completed Enrolment but no Admission Form {#sec-problem-details-16}

The Admission Form is a mandatory form that must exist exactly once for each patient admission.
It is usually created automatically, but like any event form, it can be deleted.
If the Admission form for a patient registration has been deleted, a new Admission form must be created and completed before the patient registration is completed, so that the data can be analysed later.
