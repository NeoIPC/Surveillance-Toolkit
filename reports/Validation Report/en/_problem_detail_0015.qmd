### The Patient Record Has a Completed Enrolment but no Surveillance End Form {#sec-problem-details-15}

The Surveillance End form is a mandatory form that must always be present before you complete the enrollment so that the data can be analysed afterwards.
This error message will appear in the validation report if the patient record contains a completed enrolment without a Surveillance End Form.

Please open the Tracked Entity Instance Dashboard of the patient record (see @sec-solution-1), then the patient enrolment (see @sec-solution-2), add a Surveillance End form (see @sec-solution-14), fill in the data and then complete both the form (see @sec-solution-8) and the patient enrolment (see @sec-solution-4).
