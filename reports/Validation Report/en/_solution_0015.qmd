### Opening an Event Form {#sec-solution-15}

To open an event form you must first open the relevant enrolment in the Tracked Entity Dashboard (see @sec-solution-10) and then select the event in the event timeline.
If an enrolment's event timeline contains a large number of events, it may include a Next and/or Previous button (see @fig-event-timeline-full) which allows you to navigate to the next or previous page of the timeline view to view more events.
