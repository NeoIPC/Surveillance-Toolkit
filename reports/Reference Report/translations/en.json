This means that, because of the relative homogeneity of the healthcare system, it is in principle a good benchmark. However, it should be noted that only a proportion of neonatal units in a country actually participate in NeoIPC Surveillance. Since participation is voluntary, these are typically hospitals that have a particular interest in infection prevention and are willing and able to provide the resources required for surveillance.",
