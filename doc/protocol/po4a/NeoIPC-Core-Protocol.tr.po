"Neonatal infections can broadly be separated into early-onset and late-onset "
"infections.  Most of the early-onset infections result from pregnancy- and "

"mother in the form of microbial colonisation or infection before causing an "

"infections typically stem from persons or inanimate surfaces that get in "
"close contact with the infant during neonatal care.  Since only the latter "
"are immediately actionable for the healthcare professionals working on "
"neonatology wards, NeoIPC puts a focus on those “nosocomial” late-onset "
"infections but tries to also support you, when trying to perform "
"surveillance of early-onset infections.  Although a fixed time-based cut-off "
"value does not exactly capture whether an infection was acquired from the "
"NICU environment, there is a relatively broad international consensus that a "
"72-hour cut-off value serves as a good estimator for nosocomial infections "
"in neonatology.  For this reason, infections, where the first symptoms occur "
"within a 72-hour window after birth, should not be considered nosocomial "
"infections and therefore should not be recorded in the NeoIPC core module.  "
"It is, however, possible to record them separately as early-onset infections "
"if you opt into the NeoIPC early-onset infection module.  If an infection "
"begins before 72 hours and is clearly hospital-acquired (i.e., there are "
"clear signs of infection on the catheter entry site) or starts after 72 "
"hours and is clearly vertical (e.g., all transplacental infections that are "
