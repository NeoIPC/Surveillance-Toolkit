"This document is the surveillance protocol for the core module of the NeoIPC "

"for the surveillance of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in "

msgid ""
"Worldwide, neonates and especially preterm infants are among the patient "
"groups with the highest incidence of nosocomial infections.  Some of these "
"infections can be prevented by infection-prevention measures, which must be "
"implemented in each individual neonatal unit and adapted to the specific "
"infection risks of the patients.  In many hospitals in Europe and worldwide, "
"healthcare professionals do not have good data to assess the burden of "
"healthcare-associated infections and the risk factors contributing to their "
"development or to evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention "
"interventions.  Support for surveillance of healthcare-associated infections "
"in neonates or reference data for benchmarking is not available in most "
"countries.  Where national and supranational data collection systems exist, "
"they frequently have a broad approach that is limited in its ability to "
"assess the situation with respect to infection prevention and control.  In "
"the short term, we aim to improve this situation by providing those "
"interested in IPC surveillance in neonatology with tools and methods to get "
"started, and in the longer term by potentially contributing to the formation "
"of regional surveillance infrastructures."

"Neonatal infections can broadly be separated into early-onset and late-onset "
"infections.  Most of the early-onset infections result from pregnancy- and "
"delivery-associated risks where the causative pathogens typically affect the "
"mother in the form of microbial colonisation or infection before causing an "
"infection in the child.  Most of the late-onset infections, in contrast, "
"result from healthcare-associated risks, and the pathogens causing these "
"infections typically stem from persons or inanimate surfaces that get in "
"close contact with the infant during neonatal care.  Since only the latter "
"are immediately actionable for the healthcare professionals working on "
"neonatology wards, NeoIPC puts a focus on those ânosocomialâ late-onset "
"infections but tries to also support you, when trying to perform "
"surveillance of early-onset infections.  Although a fixed time-based cut-off "
"value does not exactly capture whether an infection was acquired from the "
"NICU environment, there is a relatively broad international consensus that a "
"72-hour cut-off value serves as a good estimator for nosocomial infections "
"in neonatology.  For this reason, infections, where the first symptoms occur "
"within a 72-hour window after birth, should not be considered nosocomial "
"infections and therefore should not be recorded in the NeoIPC core module.  "
"It is, however, possible to record them separately as early-onset infections "
"if you opt into the NeoIPC early-onset infection module.  If an infection "
"begins before 72 hours and is clearly hospital-acquired (i.e., there are "
"clear signs of infection on the catheter entry site) or starts after 72 "
"hours and is clearly vertical (e.g., all transplacental infections that are "
