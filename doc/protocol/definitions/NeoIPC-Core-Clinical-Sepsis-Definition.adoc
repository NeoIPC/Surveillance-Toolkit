** CRP > 10 mg/L (> 1 mg/dL)
** Procalcitonin ≥ 2μg/L (2 ng/mL; 200 ng/dL)

*Antibiotic treatment for at least five days was initiated.
The day of the first dose and the day of the last dose are counted.
Days where no dose was administered between the first and the last dose (e.g., skipped doses because of high drug levels in therapeutic drug monitoring) are counted as if a dose had been administered.
Days after the last dose are not counted regardless of the patient's measured or assumed drug level.
If the infant died, was discharged, or transferred before the end of the five-day course of intravenous antibiotics, this condition is met if treatment was scheduled for five days or more.
