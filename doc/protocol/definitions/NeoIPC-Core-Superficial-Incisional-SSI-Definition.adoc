.. Purulent drainage from the superficial incision.
.. Organism(s) identified from an aseptically obtained specimen from the superficial incision or subcutaneous tissue by a culture or non-culture based microbiologic testing method which is performed for purposes of clinical diagnosis or treatment (for example, not Active Surveillance Culture/Testing (ASC/AST)).
.. Superficial incision that is deliberately opened by a surgeon, physician* or physician designee and culture or non-culture-based testing of the superficial incision or subcutaneous tissue is not performed.
A culture or non-culture-based test from the deep soft tissues of the incision that has a negative finding does not meet this criterion.

*The term physician for the purpose of application of the NeoIPC SSI criteria may be interpreted to mean a surgeon, infectious disease physician, emergency physician, another physician on the case, or physician’s designee (nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant).

The following do not qualify as criteria for meeting the definition of superficial incisional SSI

* Diagnosis/treatment of cellulitis (redness/warmth/swelling), by itself, does not meet superficial incisional SSI criterion ‘d’. 
* A stitch abscess alone (minimal inflammation and discharge confined to the points of suture penetration). 
* A localized stab wound or pin site infection. Note: A laparoscopic trocar site is considered a surgical incision and not a stab wound.
If a surgeon uses a laparoscopic trocar site to place a drain at the end of a procedure this is considered a surgical incision.
